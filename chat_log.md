AI Chat Log – SITE1101 Portfolio Project
This file documents the interaction with AI tools during the development of my personal portfolio website.

Topics discussed
Creating a multi-page static portfolio (Home, About, Projects).

Implementing a professional dark-themed UI with orange accents (#ff7a00).

Structuring the navigation bar and renaming sections to align with PDF requirements.

Fixing CSS issues related to image scaling (object-fit: contain) and text padding.

Highlighting academic information (ADA University) and specific section headers.

Ensuring the website is fully responsive for mobile devices.

Preparing the final file structure and documentation (README and Chat Log).

Purpose
The AI assistant was used as a technical partner to debug CSS layout issues, refine the visual aesthetic based on the assignment's PDF instructions, and ensure that the final code follows front-end development best practices. Every design decision was directed by the student to maintain academic integrity.
